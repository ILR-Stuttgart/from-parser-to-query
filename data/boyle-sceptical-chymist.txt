I Am ( sayes Carneades ) so unwilling to deny Eleutherius any thing , that though , before the rest of the Company I am resolv’d to make good the part I have undertaken of a Sceptick ; yet I shall readily , since you will have it so , lay aside for a while the Person of an Adversary to the Peripateticks and Chymists ; and before I acquaint you with my Objections against their Opinions , acknowledge to you what may be ( whether truly or not ) tollerably enough added , in favour of a certain number of Principles of mixt Bodies , to that grand and known Argument from the Analysis of compound Bodies , which I may possibly hereafter be able to confute .
And that you may the more easily Examine , and the better Judge of what I have to say , I shall cast it into a pretty number of distinct Propositions , to which I shall not premise any thing ; because I take it for granted , that you need not be advertis’d , that much of what I am to deliver , whether for or against a determinate number of Ingredients of mix’d Bodies , may be indifferently apply’d to the four Peripatetick Elements , and the three Chymical Principles , though divers of my Objections will more peculiarly belong to these last nam’d , because the Chymical Hypothesis seeming to be much more countenanc’d by Experience then the other , it will be expedient to insist chiefly upon the disproving of that ; especially since most of the Arguments that are imploy’d against it , may , by a little variation , be made to conclude , at least as strongly against the less plausible , Aristotelian Doctrine .
To proceed then to my Propositions , I shall begin with this .
That it seems not absurd to conceive that at the first Production of mixt Bodies , the Universal Matter whereof they among other Parts of the Universe consisted , was actually divided into little Particles of several sizes and shapes variously mov’d .
This ( sayes Carneades ) I suppose you will easily enough allow .
For besides that which happens in the Generation , Corruption , Nutrition , and wasting of Bodies , that which we discover partly by our Microscopes of the extream littlenesse of even the scarce sensible parts of Concretes ; and partly by the Chymical Resolutions of mixt Bodies , and by divers other Operations of Spagyrical Fires upon them , seems sufficiently to manifest their consisting of parts very minute and of differing Figures .
And that there does also intervene a various local Motion of such small Bodies , will scarce be denied ; whether we chuse to grant the Origine of Concretions assign’d by Epicurus , or that related by Moses .
For the first , as you well know , supposes not only all mixt Bodies , but all others to be produc’d by the various and casual occursions of Atomes , moving themselves to and fro by an internal Principle in the Immense or rather Infinite Vacuum .
And as for the inspir’d Historian , He , informing us that the great and Wise Author of Things did not immediately create Plants , Beasts , Birds , &c . but produc’d them out of those portions of the pre-existent , though created , Matter , that he calls Water and Earth , allows us to conceive , that the constituent Particles whereof these new Concretes were to consist , were variously moved in order to their being connected into the Bodies they were , by their various Coalitions and Textures , to compose .
But ( continues Carneades ) presuming that the first Proposition needs not be longer insisted on , I will pass on to the second , and tell you that neither is it impossible that of these minute Particles divers of the smallest and neighbouring ones were here and there associated into minute Masses or Clusters , and did by their Coalitions constitute great store of such little primary Concretions or Masses as were not easily dissipable into such Particles as compos’d them .
To what may be deduc’d , in favour of this Assertion , from the Nature of the Thing it self , I will add something out of Experience , which though I have not known it used to such a purpose , seems to me more fairly to make out that there May be Elementary Bodies , then the more questionable Experiments of Peripateticks and Chymists prove that there Are such .
I consider then that Gold will mix and be colliquated not only with Silver , Copper , Tin and Lead , but with Antimony , Regulus Martis and many other Minerals , with which it will compose Bodies very differing both from Gold , and the other Ingredients of the resulting Concretes .
And the same Gold will also by common Aqua Regis , and ( I speak it knowingly ) by divers other Menstruums be reduc’d into a seeming Liquor , in so much that the Corpuscles of Gold will , with those of the Menstruum , pass through Cap-Paper , and with them also coagulate into a Crystalline Salt .
And I have further try’d , that with a small quantity of a certain Saline Substance I prepar’d , I can easily enough sublime Gold into the form of red Crystalls of a considerable length ; and many other wayes may Gold be disguis’d , and help to constitute Bodies of very differing Natures both from It and from one another , and neverthelesse be afterward reduc’d to the self-same Numerical , Yellow , Fixt , Ponderous and Malleable Gold it was before its commixture .
Nor is it only the fixedst of Metals , but the most fugitive , that I may employ in favour of our Proposition : for Quicksilver will with divers Metals compose an Amalgam , with divers Menstruums it seems to be turn’d into a Liquor , with Aqua fortis will be brought into either a red or white Powder or precipitate , with Oyl of Vitriol into a pale Yellow one , with Sulphur it will compose a blood-red and volatile Cinaber , with some Saline Bodies it will ascend in form of a Salt which will be dissoluble in water ; with Regulus of Antimony and Silver I have seen it sublim’d into a kinde of Crystals , with another Mixture I reduc’d it into a malleable Body , into a hard and brittle Substance by another : And some there are who affirm , that by proper Additaments they can reduce Quicksilver into Oyl , nay into Glass , to mention no more .
And yet out of all these exotick Compounds , we may recover the very same running Mercury that was the main Ingredient of them , and was so disguis’d in them .
Now the Reason ( proceeds Carneades ) that I have represented these things concerning Gold and Quicksilver , is , That it may not appear absurd to conceive , that such little primary Masses or Clusters , as our Proposition mentions , may remain undissipated , notwithstanding their entring into the composition of various Concretions , since the Corpuscle of Gold and Mercury , though they be not primary Concretions of the most minute Particles or matter , but confessedly mixt Bodies , are able to concurre plentifully to the composition of several very differing Bodies , without losing their own Nature or Texture , or having their cohæsion violated by the divorce of their associated parts or Ingredients .
Give me leave to add ( sayes Eleutherius ) on this occasion , to what you now observ’d , that as confidently as some Chymists , and other modern Innovators in Philosophy are wont to object against the Peripateticks , That from the mixture of their four Elements there could arise but an inconsiderable variety of compound Bodies ; yet if the Aristotelians were but half as well vers’d in the works of Nature as they are in the Writings of their Master , the propos’d Objection would not so calmly triumph , as for want of Experiments they are fain to suffer it to do .
For if we assigne to the Corpuscles , whereof each Element consists , a peculiar size and shape , it may easily enough be manifested , That such differingly figur’d Corpuscles may be mingled in such various Proportions , and may be connected so many several wayes , that an almost incredible number of variously qualified Concretes may be compos’d of them .
Especially since the Corpuscles of one Element may barely , by being associated among themselves , make up little Masses of differing size and figure from their constituent parts : and since also to the strict union of such minute Bodies there seems oftentimes nothing requisite , besides the bare Contact of a great part of their Surfaces .
And how great a variety of Phaenomena the same matter , without the addition of any other , and only several ways dispos’d or contexed , is able to exhibit , may partly appear by the multitude of differing Engins which by the contrivances of skilful Mechanitians , and the dexterity of expert Workmen , may be made of Iron alone .
But in our present case being allow’d to deduce compound Bodies from four very differently qualified sorts of matter , he who shall but consider what you freshly took notice of concerning the new Concretes resulting from the mixture of incorporated Minerals , will scarce doubt but that the four Elements mannag’d by Natures Skill may afford a multitude of differing Compounds .
I am thus far of your minde ( sayes Carneades ) that the Aristotelians might with probability deduce a much greater number of compound Bodies from the mixture of their four Elements , than according to their present Hypothesis they can , if instead of vainly attempting to deduce the variety and properties of all mixt Bodies from the Combinations and Temperaments of the four Elements , as they are ( among them ) endowd with the four first Qualities , they had endeavoured to do it by the Bulk and Figure of the smallest parts of those supposed Elements .
For from these more Catholick and Fruitfull Accidents of the Elementary matter may spring a great variety of Textures , upon whose Account a multitude of compound Bodies may very much differ from one another .
And what I now observe touching the four Peripatetick Elements , may be also applyed , mutatis mutandis , ( as they speak ) to the Chymical Principles .
But ( to take notice of that by the by ) both the one and the other , must , I fear , call in to their assistance something that is not Elementary , to excite or regulate the motion of the parts of the matter , and dispose them after the manner requisite to the Constitution of particular Concretes .
For that otherwise they are like to give us but a very imperfect account of the Origine of very many mixt Bodies , It would , I think , be no hard matter to perswade you , if it would not spend time , and were no Digression , to examine , what they are wont to alledge of the Origine of the Textures and Qualities of mixt Bodies , from a certain substantial Form , whose Origination they leave more obscure than what it is assum’d to explicate .
But to proceed to a new Proposition .
I shall not peremptorily deny , that from most of such mixt Bodies as partake either of Animal or Vegetable Nature , there may by the Help of the Fire , be actually obtain’d a determinate number ( whether Three , Four or Five , or fewer or more ) of Substances , worthy of differing Denominations .
Of the Experiments that induce me to make this Concession , I am like to have occasion enough to mention several in the prosecution of my Discourse .
And therefore , that I may not hereafter be oblig’d to trouble You and my self with needless Repetitions , I shall now only desire you to take notice of such Experiments , when they shall be mention’d , and in your thoughts referre them hither .
To these three Concessions I have but this Fourth to add , That it may likewise be granted , that those distinct Substances , which Concretes generally either afford or are made up of , may without very much Inconvenience be call’d the Elements or Principles of them .
When I said , without very much Inconvenience , I had in my Thoughts that sober Admonition of Galen , Cum de re constat , de verbis non est Litigandum .
And therefore also I scruple not to say Elements or Principles , partly because the Chymists are wont to call the Ingredients of mixt Bodies , Principles , as the Aristotelians name them Elements ; I would here exclude neither .
And , partly , because it seems doubtfull whether the same Ingredients may not be call’d Principles ? as not being compounded of any more primary Bodies : and Elements , in regard that all mix’d Bodies are compounded of them .
But I thought it requisite to limit my Concession by premising the words , very much , to the word Inconvenience , because that though the Inconvenience of calling the distinct Substances , mention’d in the Proposition Elements or Principles , be not very great , yet that it is an Impropriety of Speech , and consequently in a matter of this moment not to be altogether overlook’d , You will perhaps think , as well as I , by that time you shall have heard the following part of my Discourse , by which you will best discern what Construction to put upon the former Propositions , and how far they may be look’d upon , as things that I concede as true , and how far as things I only represent as specious enough to be fit to be consider’d .
And now Eleutherius ( continues Carneades ) I must resume the person of a Sceptick , and as such , propose some part of what may be either dislik’t , or at least doubted of in the common Hypothesis of the Chymists : which if I examine with a little the more freedom , I hope I need not desire you ( a Person to whom I have the Happinesse of being so well known ) to look upon it as something more suitable to the Employment whereto the Company has , for this Meeting , doom’d me ; then either to my Humour or my Custom .
Now though I might present you many things against the Vulgar Chymical Opinion of the three Principles , and the Experiments wont to be alledg’d as Demonstrations of it , yet those I shall at present offer you may be conveniently enough comprehended in four Capital Considerations ; touching all which I shall only premise this in general , That since it is not my present Task so much to assert an Hypothesis of my own , as to give an Account wherefore I suspect the Truth of that of the Chymists , it ought not to be expected that all my Objections should be of the most cogent sort , since it is reason enough to Doubt of a propos’d Opinion , that there appears no cogent Reason for it .
To come then to the Objections themselves ; I consider in the first place , That notwithstanding what common Chymists have prov’d or taught , it may reasonably enough be Doubted , how far , and in what sence , Fire ought to be esteem’d the genuine and universal Instrument of analyzing mixt Bodies .
This Doubt , you may remember , was formerly mention’d , but so transiently discours’d of , that it will now be fit to insist upon it ; And manifest that it was not so inconsiderately propos’d as our Adversaries then imagin’d .
But , before I enter any farther into this Disquisition , I cannot but here take notice , that it were to be wish’d , our Chymists had clearly inform’d us what kinde of Division of Bodies by Fire must determine the number of the Elements : For it is nothing near so easy as many seem to think , to determine distinctly the Effects of Heat , as I could easily manifest , if I had leasure to shew you how much the Operations of Fire may be diversify’d by Circumstances .
But not wholly to pass by a matter of this Importance , I will first take notice to you , that Guajacum ( for Instance ) burnt with an open Fire in a Chimney , is sequestred into Ashes and Soot , whereas the same Wood distill’d in a Retort does yield far other Heterogeneities , ( to use the Helmontian expression ) and is resolv’d into Oyl , Spirit , Vinager , Water and Charcoal ; the last of which to be reduc’d into Ashes , requires the being farther calcin’d then it can be in a close Vessel : Besides having kindled Amber , and held a clean Silver Spoon , or some other Concave and smooth Vessel over the Smoak of its Flame , I observ’d the Soot into which that Fume condens’d , to be very differing from any thing that I had observ’d to proceed from the steam of Amber purposely ( for that is not usual ) distilled per se in close Vessels .
Thus having , for Tryals sake , kindled Camphire , and catcht the Smoak that copiously ascended out of the Flame , it condens’d into a Black and unctuous Soot , which would not have been guess’d by the Smell or other Properties to have proceeded from Camphire : whereas having ( as I shall otherwhere more fully declare ) expos’d a quantity of that Fugitive Concrete to a gentle heat in a close Glass-Vessel , it sublim’d up without seeming to have lost any thing of its whiteness , or its Nature , both which it retain’d , though afterwards I so encreased the Fire as to bring it to Fusion .
And , besides Camphire , there are divers other Bodies ( that I elsewhere name ) in which the heat in close Vessels is not wont to make any separation of Heterogeneities , but only a comminution of Parts , those that rise first being Homogeneal with the others , though subdivided into smaller Particles : whence Sublimations have been stiled , The Pestles of the Chymists .
But not here to mention what I elsewhere take notice of , concerning common Brimstone once or twice sublim’d , that expos’d to a moderate Fire in Subliming-Pots , it rises all into dry , and almost tastless , Flowers ; Whereas being expos’d to a naked Fire it affords store of a Saline and Fretting Liquor : Not to mention this , I say , I will further observe to you , that as it is considerable in the Analysis of mixt Bodies , whether the Fire act on them when they are expos’d to the open Air , or shut up in close Vessels , so is the degree of Fire by which the Analysis is attempted of no small moment .
For a milde Balneum will sever unfermented Blood ( for Instance ) but into Phlegme and Caput mortuum , the later whereof ( which I have sometimes had ) hard , brittle , and of divers Colours , ( transparent almost like Tortoise-shell ) press’d by a good Fire in a Retort yields a Spirit , an Oyl or two , and a volatile Salt , besides a Caput mortuum .
It may be also pertinent to our present Designe , to take notice of what happens in the making and distilling of Sope ; for by one degree of Fire the Salt , the Water and the Oyl or Grease , whereof that factitious Concrete is made up , being boyl’d up together are easily brought to mingle and incorporate into one Mass ; but by another and further degree of Heat the same Mass may be again divided into an oleagenous , an aqueous , a Saline , and an Earthy part .
And so we may observe that impure Silver and Lead being expos’d together to a moderate Fire , will thereby be colliquated into one Mass , and mingle per minima , as they speak , whereas a much vehementer Fire will drive or carry off the baser Metals ( I mean the Lead , and the Copper or other Alloy ) from the Silver , though not , for ought appears , separate them from one another .
Besides , when a Vegetable abounding in fixt Salt is analyz’d by a naked Fire , as one degree of Heat will reduce it into Ashes , ( as the Chymists themselves teach us ) so , by only a further degree of Fire , those Ashes may be vitrified and turn’d into Glass .
I will not stay to examine how far a meere Chymist might on this occasion demand , If it be lawful for an Aristotelian to make Ashes , ( which he mistakes for meere Earth ) pass for an Element , because by one degree of Fire it may be produc’d , why a Chymist may not upon the like Principle argue , that Glass is one of the Elements of many Bodies , because that also may be obtain’d from them , barely by the Fire ?
I will not , I say , lose time to examine this , but observe , that by a Method of applying the Fire , such similar Bodies may be obtain’d from a Concrete , as Chymists have not been able to separate ; either by barely burning it in an open Fire , or by barely distilling it in close Vessels .
For to me it seems very considerable , and I wonder that men have taken so little notice of it , that I have not by any of the common wayes of Distillation in close Vessels , seen any separation made of such a volatile Salt as is afforded us by Wood , when that is first by an open Fire divided into Ashes and Soot , and that Soot is afterwards plac’d in a strong Retort , and compell’d by an urgent Fire to part with its Spirit , Oyl and Salt ; for though I dare not peremptorily deny , that in the Liquors of Guajacum and other Woods distill’d in Retorts after the common manner , there may be Saline parts , which by reason of the Analogy may pretend to the name of some kinde of volatile Salts ; yet questionless there is a great disparity betwixt such Salts and that which we have sometimes obtain’d upon the first Distillation of Soot ( though for the most part it has not been separated from the first or second Rectification , and sometimes not till the third ) For we could never yet see separated from Woods analyz’d only the vulgar way in close vessels any volatile Salt in a dry and Saline form , as that of Soot , which we have often had very Crystalline and Geometrically figur’d .
And then , whereas the Saline parts of the Spirits of Guajacum , &c . appear upon distillation sluggish enough , the Salt of Soot seems to be one of the most volatile Bodies in all Nature ; and if it be well made will readily ascend with the milde heat of a Furnace , warm’d only by the single Wieck of a Lamp , to the top of the highest Glass Vessels that are commonly made use of for Distillation : and besides all this , the taste and smell of the Salt of Soot are exceeding differing from those of the Spirits of Guajacum , &c . and the former not only smells and tastes much less like a vegetable Salt , than like that of Harts-horn , and other Animal Concretes ; but in divers other Properties seems more of Kinne to the Family of Animals , than to that of vegetable Salts , as I may elsewhere ( God permitting ) have an occasion more particularly to declare .
I might likewise by some other Examples manifest , That the Chymists , to have dealt clearly , ought to have more explicitly and particularly declar’d by what Degree of Fire , and in what manner of Application of it , they would have us Judge a Division made by the Fire to be a true Analysis into their Principles , and the Productions of it to deserve the name of Elementary Bodies .
But it is time that I proceed to mention the particular Reasons that incline me to Doubt , whether the Fire be the true and universal Analyzer of mixt Bodies ; of which Reasons what has been already objected may pass for one .
In the next place I observe , That there are some mixt Bodies from which it has not been yet made appear , that any degree of Fire can separate either Salt or Sulphur or Mercury , much less all the Three .
The most obvious Instance of this Truth is Gold , which is a Body so fix’d , and wherein the Elementary Ingredients ( if it have any ) are so firmly united to each other , that we finde not in the operations wherein Gold is expos’d to the Fire , how violent soever , that it does discernably so much as lose of its fixednesse or weight , so far is it from being dissipated into those Principles , whereof one at least is acknowledged to be Fugitive enough ; and so justly did the Spagyricall Poet somewhere exclaim ,
Cuncta adeo miris illic compagibus harent .
And I must not omit on this occasion to mention to you , Eleutherius , the memorable Experiment that I remember I met with in Gasto Claveus , who , though a Lawyer by Profession , seems to have had no small Curiosity and Experience in Chymical affairs : He relates then , that having put into one small Earthen Vessel an Ounce of the most pure Gold , and into another the like weight of pure Silver , he plac’d them both in that part of a Glass-house Furnace wherein the Workmen keep their Metal , ( as our English Artificers call their Liquid Glass ) continually melted , and that having there kept both the Gold and the Silver in constant Fusion for two Moneths together , he afterwards took them out of the Furnace and the Vessels , and weighing both of them again , found that the Silver had not lost above a 12th part of its weight , but the Gold had not of his lost any thing at all .
And though our Author endeavours to give us of this a Scholastick Reason , which I suppose you would be as little satisfied with , as I was when I read it ; yet for the matter of Fact , which will serve our present turne , he assures us , that though it be strange , yet Experience it self taught it him to be most true .
And though there be not perhaps any other Body to be found so perfectly fix’d as Gold , yet there are divers others so fix’d or compos’d , at least of so strictly united parts , that I have not yet observ’d the Fire to separate from them any one of the Chymists Principles .
I need not tell you what Complaints the more Candid and Judicious of the Chymists themselves are wont to make of those Boasters that confidently pretend , that they have extracted the Salt or Sulphur of Quicksilver , when they have disguis’d it by Additaments , wherewith it resembles the Concretes whose Names are given it ; whereas by a skilful and rigid Examen , it may be easily enough stript of its Disguises , and made to appear again in the pristine form of running Mercury .
The pretended Salts and Sulphurs being so far from being Elementary parts extracted out of the Bodie of Mercurie , that they are rather ( to borrow a terme of the Grammarians ) De-compound Bodies , made up of the whole Metal and the Menstruum or other Additaments imploy’d to disguise it .
And as for Silver , I never could see any degree of Fire make it part with any of its three Principles .
And though the Experiment lately mentioned from Claveus may beget a Suspition that Silver may be dissipated by Fire , provided it be extreamly violent and very lasting : yet it will not necessarily follow , that because the Fire was able at length to make the Silver lose a little of its weight , it was therefore able to dissipate it into its Principles .
For first I might alledge that I have observ’d little Grains of Silver to lie hid in the small Cavities ( perhaps glas’d over by a vitrifying heat ) in Crucibles , wherein Silver has been long kept in Fusion , whence some Goldsmiths of my Acquaintance make a Benefit by grinding such Crucibles to powder , to recover out of them the latent particles of Silver .
And hence I might argue , that perhaps Claveus was mistaken , and imagin’d that Silver to have been driven away by the Fire , that indeed lay in minute parts hid in his Crucible , in whose pores so small a quantity as he mist of so ponderous a Bodie might very well lie conceal’d .
But Secondly , admitting that some parts of the Silver were driven away by the violence of the Fire , what proof is there that it was either the Salt , the Sulphur , or the Mercury of the Metal , and not rather a part of it homogeneous to what remain’d ?
For besides , that the Silver that was left seem’d not sensibly alter’d , which probably would have appear’d , had so much of any one of its Principles been separated from it : We finde in other Mineral Bodies of a less permanent nature than Silver , that the Fire may divide them into such minute parts , as to be able to carry them away with its self , without at all destroying their Nature .
Thus we see that in the refining of Silver , the Lead that is mix’d with it ( to carry away the Copper or other ignoble Mineral that embases the Silver ) will , if it be let alone , in time evaporate away upon the Test ; but if ( as is most usual amongst those that refine great quantities of Metals together ) the Lead be blown off from the Silver by Bellowes , that which would else have gone away in the Form of unheeded steams , will in great part be collected not far from the Silver , in the Form of a darkish Powder or Calx , which , because it is blown off from Silver , they call Litharge of Silver .
And thus Agricola in divers places informs us , when Copper , or the Oare of it is colliquated by the violence of the Fire with Cadmia , the Sparks that in great multitudes do fly upwards do , some of them , stick to the vaulted Roofs of the Furnaces , in the form of little and ( for the most part ) White Bubbles , which therefore the Greeks , and , in Imitation of them , our Drugsters call Pompholix : and others more heavy partly adhere to the sides of the Furnace , and partly ( especially if the Covers be not kept upon the Pots ) fall to the Ground , and by reason of their Ashy Colour as well as Weight were called by the same Greeks σποδος , which , I need not tell you , in their Language signifies Ashes .
I might add , that I have not found that from Venetian Talck ( I say Venetian , because I have found other kinds of that Mineral more open ) from the Lapis Ossifragus , ( which the Shops call Ostiocolla ) from Muscovia Glass , from pure and Fusible Sand , to mention now no other Concretes ; those of my Acquaintance that have try’d have been able by the Fire to separate any one of the Hypostatical Principles , which you will the less scruple to believe , if you consider that Glass may be made by the bare Colliquation of the Salt and Earth remaining in the Ashes of a burnt Plant , and that yet common Glass , once made , does so far resist the violence of the Fire , that most Chymists think it a Body more undestroyable then Gold it self .
For if the Artificer can so firmly unite such comparative gross Particles as those of Earth and Salt that make up common Ashes , into a Body indissoluble by Fire ; why may not Nature associate in divers Bodies the more minute Elementary Corpuscles she has at hand too firmly to let them be separable by the Fire ?
And on this Occasion , Eleutherius , give me leave to mention to you two or three sleight Experiments , which will , I hope , be found more pertinent to our present Discourse , than at first perhaps they will appear .
The first is , that , having ( for Tryals sake ) put a quantity of that Fugitive Concrete , Camphire , into a Glass Vessel , and plac’d it in a gentle Heat , I found it ( not leaving behinde , according to my Estimate , not so much as one Grain ) to sublime to the Top of the Vessel into Flowers : which in Whiteness , Smell , &c . seem’d not to differ from the Camphire it self .
Another Experiment is that of Helmont , who in several places affirms , That a Coal kept in a Glass exactly clos’d will never be calcin’d to Ashes , though kept never so long in a strong Fire .
To countenance which I shall tell you this Tryal of my own , That having sometimes distilled some Woods , as particularly Box , whilst our Caput mortuum remain’d in the Retort , it continued black like Charcoal , though the Retort were Earthen , and kept red-hot in a vehement Fire ; but as soon as ever it was brought out of the candent Vessel into the open Air , the burning Coals did hastily degenerate or fall asunder , without the Assistance of any new Calcination , into pure white Ashes .
And to these two I shall add but this obvious and known Observation , that common Sulphur ( if it be pure and freed from its Vinager ) being leasurely sublim’d in close Vessels , rises into dry Flowers , which may be presently melted into a Bodie of the same Nature with that which afforded them .
Though if Brimstone be burnt in the open Air it gives , you know , a penetrating Fume , which being caught in a Glass-Bell condenses into that acid Liquor called Oyl of Sulphur per Campanam .
The use I would make of these Experiments collated with what I lately told you out of Agricola is this , That even among the Bodies that are not fixt , there are divers of such a Texture , that it will be hard to make it appear , how the Fire , as Chymists are wont to imploy it , can resolve them into Elementary Substances .
For some Bodies being of such a Texture that the Fire can drive them into the cooler and less hot part of the Vessels wherein they are included , and if need be , remove them from place to place to fly the greatest heat , more easily than it can divorce their Elements ( especially without the Assistance of the Air ) we see that our Chymists cannot Analyze them in close Vessels , and of other compound Bodies the open Fire can as little separate the Elements .
For what can a naked Fire do to Analyze a mixt Bodie , if its component Principles be so minute , and so strictly united , that the Corpuscles of it need less heat to carry them up , than is requisite to divide them into their Principles .
So that of some Bodies the Fire cannot in close Vessels make any Analysis at all , and others will in the open Air fly away in the Forms of Flowers or Liquors , before the Heat can prove able to divide them into their Principles .
And this may hold , whether the various similar parts of a Concrete be combin’d by Nature or by Art ; For in factitious Sal Armoniack we finde the common and the Urinous Salts so well mingled , that both in the open Fire , and in subliming Vessels they rise together as one Salt , which seems in such Vessels irresoluble by Fire alone .
For I can shew you Sal Armoniack which after the ninth Sublimation does still retain its compounded Nature .
And indeed I scarce know any one Mineral , from which by Fire alone Chymists are wont to sever any Substance simple enough to deserve the name of an Element or Principle .
For though out of native Cinnaber they distill Quicksilver , and though from many of those Stones that the Ancients called Pyrites they sublime Brimstone , yet both that Quicksilver and this Sulphur being very often the same with the common Minerals that are sold in the Shops under those names , are themselves too much compounded Bodies to pass for the Elements of such .
And thus much , Eleutherius , for the Second Argument that belongs to my First Consideration ; the others I shall the lesse insist on , because I have dwelt so long upon this .

Proceed we then in the next place to consider , That there are divers Separations to be made by other means , which either cannot at all , or else cannot so well be made by the Fire alone .
When Gold and Silver are melted into one Mass , it would lay a great Obligation upon Refiners and Goldsmiths to teach them the Art of separating them by the Fire , without the trouble and charge they are fain to be at to sever them .
Whereas they may be very easily parted by the Affusion of Spirit of Nitre or Aqua fortis ( which the French therefore call Eau de Depart : ) so likewise the Metalline part of Vitriol will not be so easily and conveniently separated from the Saline part even by a violent Fire , as by the Affusion of certain Alkalizate Salts in a liquid Form upon the Solution of Vitriol made in common water .
For thereby the acid Salt of the Vitriol , leaving the Copper it had corroded to joyn with the added Salts , the Metalline part will be precipitated to the bottom almost like Mud .
And that I may not give Instances only in De-compound Bodies , I will add a not useless one of another kinde .
Not only Chymists have not been able ( for ought is vulgarly known ) by Fire alone to separate true Sulphur from Antimony ; but though you may finde in their Books many plausible Processes of Extracting it , yet he that shall make as many fruitlesse Tryals as I have done to obtain it by , most of them will , I suppose , be easily perswaded , that the Productions of such Processes are Antimonial Sulphurs rather in Name than Nature .
But though Antimony sublim’d by its self is reduc’d but to a volatile Powder , or Antimonial Flowers , of a compounded Nature like the Mineral that affords them : yet I remember that some years ago I sublim’d out of Antimony a Sulphur , and that in greater plenty then ever I saw obtain’d from that Mineral , by a Method which I shall therefore acquaint you with , because Chymists seem not to have taken notice of what Importance such Experiments may be in the Indagation of the Nature , and especially of the Number of the Elements .
Having then purposely for Tryals sake digested eight Ounces of good and well powder’d Antimony with twelve Ounces of Oyl of Vitriol in a well stopt Glas-Vessel for about six or seven Weeks ; and having caus’d the Mass ( grown hard and brittle ) to be distill’d in a Retort plac’d in Sand , with a strong Fire ; we found the Antimony to be so opened , or alter’d by the Menstruum wherewith it had been digested , That whereas crude Antimony , forc’d up by the Fire , arises only in Flowers , our Antimony thus handled afforded us partly in the Receiver , and partly in the Neck and at the Top of the Retort , about an Ounce of Sulphur , yellow and brittle like common Brimstone , and of so Sulphureous a smell , that upon the unluting the Vessels it infected the Room with a scarce supportable stink .
And this Sulphur , besides the Colour and Smell , had the perfect Inflamability of common Brimstone , and would immediately kindle ( at the Flame of a Candle ) and burn blew like it .
And though it seem’d that the long digestion wherein our Antimony and Menstruum were detain’d , did conduce to the better unlocking of the Mineral , yet if you have not the leasure to make so long a Digestion , you may by incorporating with powder’d Antimony a convenient Quantity of Oyl of Vitriol , and committing them immediately to Distillation , obtain a little Sulphur like unto the common one , and more combustible than perhaps you will at first take notice of .
For I have observ’d , that though ( after its being first kindled ) the Flame would sometimes go out too soon of its self , if the same Lump of Sulphur were held again to the Flame of a Candle , it would be rekindled and burn a pretty while , not only after the second , but after the third or fourth accension .
You , to whom I think I shewed my way of discovering something of Sulphureous in Oyl of Vitriol , may perchance suspect , Eleutherius , either that this Substance was some Venereal Sulphur that lay hid in that Liquor , and was by this operation only reduc’d into a manifest Body ; or else that it was a compound of the unctuous parts of the Antimony , and the Saline ones of the Vitriol , in regard that ( as GuntherLib .

Cap .

But the Quantity of Sulphur we obtain’d by Digestion was much too great to have been latent in the Oyl of Vitriol .
And that Vitriolate Spirits are not necessary to the Constitution of such a Sulphur as ours , I could easily manifest , if I would acquaint you with the several wayes by which I have obtain’d , though not in such plenty , a Sulphur of Antimony , colour’d and combustible like common Brimstone .
And though I am not now minded to discover them , yet I shall tell you , that to satisfie some Ingenious Men , that distill’d Vitriolate Spirits are not necessary to the obtaining of such a Sulphur as we have been considering , I did by the bare distillation of only Spirit of Nitre , from its weight of crude Antimony separate , in a short time , a yellow and very inflamable Sulphur , which , for ought I know , deserves as much the name of an Element , as any thing that Chymists are wont to separate from any Mineral by the Fire .
I could perhaps tell you of other Operations upon Antimony , whereby That may be extracted from it , which cannot be forc’d out of it by the Fire ; but I shall reserve them for a fitter Opportunity , and only annex at present this sleight , but not impertinent Experiment .
That whereas I lately observed to you , that the Urinous and common Salts whereof Sal Armoniack consists , remain’d unsever’d by the Fire in many successive Sublimations , they may be easily separated , and partly without any Fire at all , by pouring upon the Concrete finely powder’d , a Solution of Salt of Tartar , or of the Salt of Wood-Ashes ; for upon your diligently mixing of these you will finde your Nose invaded with a very strong smell of Urine , and perhaps too your Eyes forc’d to water by the same subtle and piercing Body that produces the stink ; both these effects proceeding from hence , that by the Alcalizate Salt , the Sea Salt that enter’d the composition of the Sal Armoniack is mortify’d and made more fixt , and thereby a divorce is made between it and the volatile Urinous Salt , which being at once set at liberty , and put into motion , begins presently to fly away , and to offend the Nostrils and Eyes it meets with by the way .
And if the operation of these Salts be in convenient Glasses promoted by warmth , though but by that of a Bath , the ascending Steams may easily be caught and reduc’d into a penetrant Spirit , abounding with a Salt , which I have sometimes found to be separable in a Crystalline Form .
I might add to these Instances , that whereas Sublimate , consisting , as you know , of Salts & Quicksilver combin’d and carried up together by Heat , may be Sublim’d , I know not how often , by a like degree of Fire , without suffering any divorce of the component Bodies , the Mercury may be easily sever’d from the adhering Salts , if the Sublimate be distill’d from Salt of Tartar , Quick Lime , or such Alcalizate Bodies .
But I will rather observe to you , Eleutherius , what divers ingenious men have thought somewhat strange ; that by such an Additament that seems but only to promote the Separation , there may be easily obtain’d from a Concrete that by the Fire alone is easily divisible into all the Elements that Vegetables are suppos’d to consist of , such a similar Substance as differs in many respects from them all , and consequently has by many of the most Intelligent Chymists been denied to be contain’d in the mixt Body .
For I know a way , and have practis’d it , whereby common Tartar , without the addition of any thing that is not perfectly a Mineral except Salt-petre , may by one Distillation in an Earthen Retort be made to afford good store of real Salt , readily dissoluble in water , which I found to be neither acid , nor of the smell of Tartar , and to be almost as volatile as Spirit of Wine it self , and to be indeed of so differing a Nature from all that is wont to be separated by Fire from Tartar , that divers Learned Men , with whom I discours’d of it , could hardly be brought to beleeve , that so fugitive a Salt could be afforded by Tartar , till I assur’d it them upon my own Knowledge .
And if I did not think you apt to suspect me to be rather too backward than too forward to credit or affirm unlikely things , I could convince you by what I have yet lying by me of that anomalous Salt .
The Fourth thing that I shall alledge to countenance my first Consideration is , That the Fire even when it divides a Body into Substances of divers Consistences , does not most commonly analyze it into Hypostatical Principles , but only disposes its parts into new Textures , and thereby produces Concretes of a new indeed , but yet of a compound Nature .
This Argument it will be requisite for me to prosecute so fully hereafter , that I hope you will then confess that ’tis not for want of good Proofs that I desire leave to suspend my Proofs till the Series of my Discourse shall make it more proper and seasonable to propose them .
It may be further alledg’d on the behalf of my First Consideration , That some such distinct Substances may be obtain’d from some Concretes without Fire , as deserve no less the name of Elementary , than many that Chymists extort by the Violence of the Fire .
We see that the Inflamable Spirit , or as the Chymists esteem it , the Sulphur of Wine , may not only be separated from it by the gentle heat of a Bath , but may be distill’d either by the help of the Sun-Beams , or even of a Dunghill , being indeed of so Fugitive a Nature , that it is not easy to keep it from flying away , even without the Application of external heat .
I have likewise observ’d that a Vessel full of Urine being plac’d in a Dunghill , the Putrefaction is wont after some weeks so to open the Body , that the parts disbanding the Saline Spirit , will within no very long time , if the Vessel be not stopt , fly away of it self ; Insomuch that from such Urine I have been able to distill little or nothing else than a nauseous Phlegme , instead of the active and piercing Salt and Spirit that it would have afforded , when first expos’d to the Fire , if the Vessel had been carefully stopt .
And this leads me to consider in the Fifth place , That it will be very hard to prove , that there can no other Body or way be given which will as well as the Fire divide Concretes into several homogeneous Substances , which may consequently be call’d their Elements or Principles , as well as those separated or produc’d by the Fire .
For since we have lately seen , that Nature can successefully employ other Instruments than the Fire to separate distinct Substances from mixt Bodies , how know we , but that Nature has made , or Art may make , some such Substance as may be a fit Instrument to Analyze mixt Bodies , or that some such Method may be found by Humane Industry or Luck , by whose means compound Bodies may be resolv’d into other Substances , than such as they are wont to be divided into by the Fire .
And why the Products of such an Analysis may not as justly be call’d the component Principles of the Bodies that afford them , it will not be easy to shew , especially since I shall hereafter make it evident , that the Substances which Chymists are wont to call the Salts , and Sulphurs , and Mercuries of Bodies , are not so pure and Elementary as they presume , and as their Hypothesis requires .
And this may therefore be the more freely press’d upon the Chymists , because neither the Paracelsians , nor the Helmontians can reject it without apparent Injury to their respective Masters .
For Helmont do’s more than once Inform his Readers , that both Paracelsus and Himself were Possessors of the famous Liquor , Alkahest , which for its great power in resolving Bodies irresoluble by Vulgar Fires , he somewhere seems to call Ignis Gehennae .
To this Liquor he ascribes , ( and that in great part upon his own Experience ) such wonders , that if we suppose them all true , I am so much the more a Friend to Knowledge than to Wealth , that I should think the Alkahest a nobler and more desireable Secret than the Philosophers Stone it self .
Of this Universal Dissolvent he relates , That having digested with it for a competent time a piece of Oaken Charcoal , it was thereby reduc’d into a couple of new and distinct Liquors , discriminated from each other by their Colour and Situation , and that the whole body of the Coal was reduc’d into those Liquors , both of them separable from his Immortal Menstruum , which remain’d as fit for such Operations as before .
And he moreover tells us in divers places of his Writings , that by this powerful , and unwearied Agent , he could dissolve Metals , Marchasites , Stones , Vegetable and Animal Bodies of what kinde soever , and even Glass it self ( first reduc’d to powder , ) and in a word , all kinds of mixt Bodies in the World into their several similar Substances , without any Residence or Caput mortuum .
And lastly , we may gather this further from his Informations , That the homogeneous Substances obtainable from compound Bodies by his piercing Liquor , were oftentimes different enough both as to Number and as to Nature , from those into which the same Bodies are wont to be divided by common Fire .
Of which I shall need in this place to mention no other proof , then that whereas we know that in our common Analysis of a mixt Body , there remains a terrestrial and very fixt Substance , oftentimes associated with a Salt as fixt ; Our Author tells us , that by his way he could Distill over all Concretes without any Caput mortuum , and consequently could make those parts of the Concrete volatile , which in the Vulgar Analysis would have been fixt .
So that if our Chymists will not reject the solemn and repeated Testimony of a Person , who cannot but be acknowledg’d for one of the greatest Spagyrists that they can boast of , they must not deny that there is to be found in Nature another Agent able to Analyze compound Bodies less violently , and both more genuinely and more universally than the Fire .
And for my own part , though I cannot but say on this Occasion what ( you know ) our Friend Mr .
Boyle is wont to say , when he is askt his Opinion of any strange Experiment ; That He that hath seen it hath more Reason to beleeve it , than He that hath not ; yet I have found Helmont so faithful a Writer , even in divers of his improbable Experiments ( I alwayes except that Extravagant Treatise De Magnetica Vulnerum Curatione , which some of his Friends affirm to have been first publish’d by his Enemies ) that I think it somewhat harsh to give him the Lye , especially to what he delivers upon his own proper Tryal .
And I have heard from very credible Eye-witnesses some things , and seen some others my self , which argue so strongly , that a circulated Salt , or a Menstruum ( such as it may be ) may by being abstracted from compound Bodies , whether Mineral , Animal , or Vegetable , leave them more unlockt than a wary Naturalist would easily beleeve , that I dare not confidently measure the Power of Nature and Art by that of the Menstruums , and other Instruments that eminent Chymists themselves are as yet wont to Empoly about the Analyzing of Bodies ; nor Deny that a Menstruum may at least from this or that particular Concrete obtain some apparently similar Substance , differing from any obtainable from the same Body by any degree or manner of Application of the Fire .
And I am the more backward to deny peremptorily , that there may be such Openers of compound Bodies , because among the Experiments that make me speak thus warily , there wanted not some in which it appear’d not , that one of the Substances not separable by common Fires and Menstruums could retain any thing of the Salt by which the separation was made .
And here , Eleutherius , ( sayes Carneades ) I should conclude as much of my Discourse as belongs to the first Consideration I propos’d , but that I foresee , that what I have delivered will appear liable to two such specious Objections , that I cannot safely proceed any further till I have examin’d them .
And first , one sort of Opposers will be forward to tell me , That they do not pretend by Fire alone to separate out of all compound Bodies their Hypostatical Principles ; it being sufficient that the Fire divides them into such , though afterwards they employ other Bodies to collect the similar parts of the Compound ; as ’tis known , that though they make use of water to collect the Saline parts of Ashes from the Terrestrial wherewith they are blended , yet it is the Fire only that Incinerates Bodies , and reduces the fix’d part of them into the Salt and Earth , whereof Ashes are made up .
This Objection is not , I confess , inconsiderable , and I might in great part allow of it , without granting it to make against me , if I would content my self to answer , that it is not against those that make it that I have been disputing , but against those Vulgar Chymists , who themselves believe , and would fain make others do so , That the Fire is not only an universal , but an adaequate and sufficient Instrument to analyze mixt Bodies with .
For as to their Practice of Extracting the fix’d Salt out of Ashes by the Affusion of Water , ’tis obvious to alleadge , that the Water does only assemble together the Salt the Fire had before divided from the Earth : as a Sieve does not further break the Corn , but only bring together into two distinct heaps the Flour and the Bran , whose Corpuscles before lay promiscuously blended together in the Meal .
This I say I might alleadge , and thereby exempt my self from the need of taking any farther notice of the propos’d Objection .
But not to lose the Rise it may afford me of Illustrating the matter under Consideration , I am content briefly to consider it , as far forth as my present Disquisition may be concern’d in it .
Not to repeat then what has been already answer’d , I say farther , that though I am so civil an Adversary , that I will allow the Chymists , after the Fire has done all its work , the use of fair Water to make their Extractions with , in such cases wherein the Water does not cooperate with the Fire to make the Analysis ; yet since I Grant this but upon Supposition that the Water does only wash off the Saline Particles , which the Fire Alone has Before Extricated in the Analyz’d Body , it will not be Reasonable , that this Concession should Extend to other Liquors that may Add to what they Dissolve , nor so much as to other Cases than those Newly Mentioned : Which Limitation I Desire You would be Pleas’d to Bear in Mind till I shall Anon have Occasion to make Use of it .
And This being thus Premis’d , I shall Proceed to Observe ,
First , That Many of the Instances I Propos’d in the Preceding Discourse are Such , that the Objection we are Considering will not at all Reach Them .
For Fire can no more with the Assistance of Water than without it Separate any of the Three Principles , either from Gold , Silver , Mercury , or some Others of the Concretes named Above .
Hence We may Inferre , That Fire is not an Universal Analyzer of all Mixt Bodies , since of Metals and Minerals , wherein Chymists have most Exercis’d Themselves , there Appear scarce Any which they are able to Analyze by Fire , Nay , from which they can Unquestionably Separate so much as any One of their Hypostatical Principles ; Which may well Appear no small Disparagement as well to their Hypothesis as to their Pretensions .
It will also remain True , notwithstanding the Objection , That there may be Other Wayes than the wonted Analysis by Fire , to Separate from a Compound Body Substances as Homogeneneous as those that Chymists Scruple not to Reckon among their Tria Prima ( as some of them , for Brevity Sake , call their Three Principles .
)
And it Appears , That by Convenient Additaments such Substances may be Separated by the Help of the Fire , as could not be so by the Fire alone : Witness the Sulphur of Antimony .
And Lastly , I must Represent , That since it appears too that the Fire is but One of the Instruments that must be Employ’d in the Resolution of Bodies , We may Reasonably Challenge the Liberty of doing Two Things .
For when ever any Menstruum or other Additament is Employ’d , together with the Fire to Obtain a Sulphur or a Salt from a Body , We may well take the Freedom to Examine , whether or no That Menstruum do barely Help to Separate the Principle Obtain’d by It , or whether there Intervene not a Coalition of the Parts of the Body Wrought upon with Those of the Menstruum , whereby the Produc’d Concrete may be Judg’d to Result from the Union of Both .
And it will be farther Allowable for Us to Consider , how far any Substance , Separated by the Help of such Additaments , Ought to pass for one of the Tria Prima ; since by One Way of Handling the same Mixt Body it may according to the Nature of the Additaments , and the Method of Working upon it , be made to Afford differing Substances from those Obtainable from it by other Additaments , and another Method , nay and ( as may appear by what I Formerly told You about Tartar ) Differing from any of the Substances into which a Concrete is Divisible by the Fire without Additaments , though perhaps those Additaments do not , as Ingredients , enter the Composition of the Obtained Body , but only Diversify the Operation of the Fire upon the Concrete ; and though that Concrete by the Fire alone may be Divided into a Number of Differing Substances , as Great as any of the Chymists that I have met with teach us that of the Elements to be .
And having said thus much ( sayes Carneades ) to the Objection likely to be Propos’d by some Chymists , I am now to Examine that which I Foresee will be Confidently press’d by Divers Peripateticks , who , to Prove Fire to be the true Analyzer of Bodies , will Plead , That it is the very Definition of Heat given by Aristotle , and Generally Received , Congregare Homogenea , & Heterogenea Segregare , to Assemble Things of a Resembling , and Disjoyn those of a Differing Nature .
To this I answer , That this Effect is far from being so Essential to Heat , as ’tis Generally Imagin’d ; for it rather Seems , that the True and Genuine Property of Heat is , to set a Moving , and thereby to Dissociate the parts of Bodies , and Subdivide them into Minute Particles , without regard to their being Homogeneous or Heterogeneous , as is apparent in the Boyling of Water , the Distillation of Quicksilver , or the Exposing of Bodies to the action of the Fire , whose Parts either Are not ( at least in that Degree of Heat Appear not ) Dissimilar , where all that the Fire can do , is to Divide the Body into very Minute Parts which are of the same Nature with one another , and with their Totum , as their Reduction by Condensation Evinces .
And even when the Fire seems most so Congregare Homogenea , & Segregare Heterogenea , it Produces that Effect but by Accident ; For the Fire does but Dissolve the Cement , or rather Shatter the Frame , or structure that kept the Heterogeneous Parts of Bodies together , under one Common Form ; upon which Dissolution the Component Particles of the Mixt , being Freed and set at Liberty , do Naturally , and oftentimes without any Operation of the Fire , Associate themselves each with its Like , or rather do take those places which their Several Degrees of Gravity and Levity , Fixedness or Volatility ( either Natural , or Adventitious from the Impression of the Fire ) Assigne them .
Thus in the Distillation ( for Instance ) of Man’s Blood , the Fire do’s First begin to Dissolve the Nexus or Cement of the Body ; and then the Water , being the most Volatile , and Easy to be Extracted , is either by the Igneous Atomes , or the Agitation they are put into by the Fire , first carried up , till Forsaken by what carried it up , its Weight sinks it down into the Receiver : but all this while the other Principles of the Concrete Remain Unsever’d , and Require a stronger Degree of Heat to make a Separation of its more Fixt Elements ; and therefore the Fire must be Increas’d which Carries over the Volatile Salt and the Spirit , they being , though Beleev’d to be Differing Principles , and though Really of Different Consistency , yet of an almost Equal Volatility .
After them , as less Fugitive , comes over the Oyl , and leaves behinde the Earth and the Alcali , which being of an Equal Fixednesse , the Fire Severs them not , for all the Definition of the Schools .
And if into a Red-hot Earthen or Iron Retort you cast the Matter to be Distill’d , You may Observe , as I have often done , that the Predominant Fire will Carry up all the Volatile Elements Confusedly in one Fume , which will afterwards take their Places in the Receiver , either according to the Degree of their Gravity , or according to the Exigency of their respective Textures ; the Salt Adhering , for the most part , to the Sides and Top , and the Phlegme Fastening it self there too in great Drops , the Oyle and Spirit placing themselves Under , or Above one another , according as their Ponderousness makes them Swim or Sink .
For ’tis Observable , that though Oyl or Liquid Sulphur be one of the Elements Separated by this Fiery Analysis , yet the Heat which Accidentally Unites the Particles of the other Volatile Principles , has not alwayes the same Operation on this , there being divers Bodies which Yield Two Oyls , whereof the One sinks to the Bottom of that Spirit on which the other Swims ; as I can shew You in some Oyls of the same Deers Blood , which are yet by Me : Nay I can shew you Two Oyls carefully made of the same Parcel of Humane Blood , which not only Differ extreamly in Colour , but Swim upon one another without Mixture , and if by Agitation Confounded will of themselves Divorce again .
And that the Fire doth oftentimes divide Bodies , upon the account that some of their Parts are more Fixt , and some more Volatile , how far soever either of these Two may be from a pure Elementary Nature is Obvious enough , if Men would but heed it in the Burning of Wood , which the Fire Dissipates into Smoake and Ashes : For not only the latter of these is Confessedly made up of two such Differing Bodies as Earth and Salt ; but the Former being condens’d into that Soot which adheres to our Chimneys , Discovers it self to Contain both Salt and Oyl , and Spirit and Earth , ( and some Portion of Phlegme too ) which being , all almost , Equally Volatile to that Degree of Fire which Forces them up , ( the more Volatile Parts Helping perhaps , as well as the Urgency of the Fire , to carry up the more Fixt ones , as I have often Try’d in Dulcify’d Colcothar , Sublim’d by Sal Armoniack Blended with it ) are carried Up together , but may afterwards be Separated by other Degrees of Fire , whose orderly Gradation allowes the Disparity of their Volatileness to Discover it self .
Besides , if Differing Bodies United into one Mass be both sufficiently Fixt , the Fire finding no Parts Volatile enough to be Expell’d or carried up , makes no Separation at all ; as may appear by a Mixture of Colliquated Silver and Gold , whose Component Metals may be easily Sever’d by Aqua Fortis , or Aqua Regis ( according to the Predominancy of the Silver or the Gold ) but in the Fire alone , though vehement , the Metals remain unsever’d , the Fire only dividing the Body into smaller Particles ( whose Littlenesse may be argu’d from their Fluidity ) in which either the little nimble Atoms of Fire , or its brisk and numberless strokes upon the Vessels , hinder Rest and Continuity , without any Sequestration of Elementary Principles .
Moreover , the Fire sometimes does not Separate , so much as Unite , Bodies of a differing Nature ; provided they be of an almost resembling Fixedness , and have in the Figure of their Parts an Aptness to Coalition , as we see in the making of many Plaisters , Oyntments , &c . And in such Metalline Mixtures as that made by Melting together two parts of clean Brass with one of pure Copper , of which some Ingenious Trades-men cast such curious Patterns ( for Gold and Silver Works ) as I have sometimes taken great Pleasure to Look upon .
Sometimes the Bodies mingled by the Fire are Differing enough as to Fixidity and Volatility , and yet are so combin’d by the first Operation of the Fire , that it self does scarce afterwards Separate them , but only Pulverize them ; whereof an Instance is afforded us by the Common Preparation of Mercurius Dulcis , where the Saline Particles of the Vitriol , Sea Salt , and sometimes Nitre , Employ’d to make the Sublimate , do so unite themselves with the Mercurial Particles made use of , first to Make Sublimate , and then to Dulcifie it , that the Saline and Metalline Parts arise together in many successive Sublimations , as if they all made but one Body .
And sometimes too the Fire does not only not Sever the Differing Elements of a Body , but Combine them so firmly , that Nature her self does very seldom , if ever , make Unions less Dissoluble .
For the Fire meeting with some Bodies exceedingly and almost equally Fixt , instead of making a Separation , makes an Union so strict , that it self , alone , is unable to Dissolve it ; As we see , when an Alcalizate Salt and the Terrestrial Residue of the Ashes are Incorporated with pure Sand , and by Vitrification made one permanent Body , ( I mean the course or greenish sort of Glass ) that mocks the greatest Violence of the Fire , which though able to Marry the Ingredients of it , yet is not able to Divorce them .
I can shew you some pieces of Glass which I saw flow down from an Earthen Crucible purposely Expos’d for a good while , with Silver in it , to a very vehement Fire .
And some that deal much in the Fusion of Metals Informe me , that the melting of a great part of a Crucible into Glass is no great Wonder in their Furnaces .
I remember , I have Observ’d too in the Melting of great Quantities of Iron out of the Oar , by the Help of store of Charcoal ( for they Affirm that Sea-Coal will not yield a Flame strong enough ) that by the prodigious Vehemence of the Fire , Excited by vast Bellows ( made to play by great Wheels turn’d about by Water ) part of the Materials Expos’d to it was , instead of being Analyz’d , Colliquated , and turn’d into a Dark , Solid and very Ponderous Glass , and that in such Quantity , that in some places I have seen the very High-wayes , neer such Iron-works , mended with Heaps of such Lumps of Glasse , instead of Stones and Gravel .
And I have also Observ’d , that some kind of Fire-stone it Self , having been employ’d in Furnaces wherein it was expos’d to very strong and lasting Fires , has had all its Fixt Parts so Wrought on by the Fire , as to be Perfectly Vitrifi’d , which I have try’d by Forcing from it Pretty large Pieces of Perfect and Transparent Glass .
And lest You might think , Eleutherius , that the Question’d Definition of Heat may be Demonstrated , by the Definition which is wont to be given and Acquiesc’d in , of its contrary Quality , Cold , whose property is taught to be tam Homogenea , quam Heterogenea congregare ; Give me leave to represent to You , that neither is this Definition unquestionable ; for not to Mention the Exceptions , which a Logician , as such , may Take at it , I Consider that the Union of Heterogeneous Bodies which is Suppos’d to be the Genuine Production of Cold , is not Perform’d by every Degree of Cold .
For we see for Instance that in the Urine of Healthy Men , when the Liquor has been Suffer’d a while to stand , the Cold makes a Separation of the Thinner Part from the Grosser , which Subsides to the Bottom , and Growes Opacous there ; whereas if the Urinal be Warme , these Parts readily Mingle again , and the whole Liquor becomes Transparent as before .
And when , by Glaciation , Wood , Straw , Dust , Water , &c . are Suppos’d to be United into one Lump of Ice , the Cold does not Cause any Real Union or Adunation , ( if I may so Speak ) of these Bodies , but only Hardening the Aqueous Parts of the Liquor into Ice , the other Bodies being Accidentally Present in that Liquor are frozen up in it , but not Really United .
And accordingly if we Expose a Heap of Mony Consisting of Gold , Silver and Copper Coynes , or any other Bodies of Differing Natures , which are Destitute of Aqueous Moisture , Capable of Congelation , to never so intense a Cold , we find not that these Differing Bodies are at all thereby so much as Compacted , much less United together ; and even in Liquors Themselves we find Phaenomena which Induce us to Question the Definition which we are examining .
If Paracelsus his Authority were to be look’t upon as a Sufficient Proof in matters of this Nature , I might here insist on that Process of his , whereby he Teaches that the Essence of Wine may be Sever’d from the Phlegme and Ignoble Part by the Assistance of Congelation : and because much Weight has been laid upon this Process , not only by Paracelsians , but other Writers , some of whom seem not to have perus’d it themselves , I shall give You the entire Passage in the Authors own Words , as I lately found them in the sixth Book of his Archidoxis , an Extract whereof I have yet about me ; and it sounds thus .
De Vino sciendum est , fæcem phlegmaque ejus esse Mineram , & Vini substantiam esse corpus in quo conservatur Essentia , prout auri in auro latet Essentia .
Juxta quod Practicam nobis ad Memoriam ponimus , ut non obliviscamur , ad hunc modum : Recipe Vinum vetustissimum & optimum quod habere poteris , calore saporeque ad placitum , hoc in vas vitreum infundas ut tertiam ejus partem impleat , & sigillo Hermetis occlusum in equino ventre mensibus quatuor , & in continuato calore teneatur qui non deficiat .
Quo peracto , Hyeme cum frigus & gelu maxime sæviunt , his per mensem exponatur ut congeletur .
Ad hunc modum frigus vini spiritum una cum ejus substantia protrudit in vini centrum , ac separat a phlegmate : Congelatum abjice , quod vero congelatum non est , id Spiritum cum substantia esse judicato .
Hunc in Pelicanum positum in arenæ digestione non adeo calida per aliquod tempus manere finito ; Postmodum eximito vini Magisterium , de quo locuti sumus .
But I dare not Eleu .
lay much Weight upon this Process , because I have found that if it were True , it would be but seldom Practicable in this Country upon the best Wine : for Though this present Winter hath been Extraordinary Cold , yet in very Keen Frosts accompanied with lasting Snowes , I have not been able in any Measure to Freeze a thin Vial full of Sack ; and even with Snow and Salt I could Freeze little more then the Surface of it ; and I suppose Eleu .
that tis not every Degree of Cold that is Capable of Congealing Liquors , which is able to make such an Analysis ( if I may so call it ) of them by Separating their Aqueous and Spirituous Parts ; for I have sometimes , though not often , frozen severally , Red-wine , Urine and Milk , but could not Observe the expected Separation .
And the Dutch-Men that were forc’d to Winter in that Icie Region neer the Artick Circle , call’d Nova Zembla , although they relate , as we shall see below , that there was a Separation of Parts made in their frozen Beer about the middle of November , yet of the Freezing of their Back in December following they give but this Account : Yea and our Sack , which is so hot , was Frozen very hard , so that when we were every Man to have his part , we were forc’d to melt it in the Fire ; which we shar’d every second Day , about half a Pinte for a Man , wherewith we were forc’d to sustain our selves .
In which words they imply not , that their Back was divided by the Frost into differing Substances , after such manner as their Beer had been .
All which notwithstanding , Eleu .
suppose that it may be made to appear , that even Cold sometimes may Congregare Homogenea , & Heterogenea Segregare : and to Manifest this I may tell you , that I did once , purposely cause to be Decocted in fair Water a Plant abounding with Sulphureous and Spirituous Parts , and having expos’d the Decoction to a keen North-Wind in a very Frosty Night , I observ’d , that the more Aqueous Parts of it were turn’d by the next Morning into Ice , towards the innermost part of which , the more Agile and Spirituous parts , as I then conjectur’d , having Retreated , to shun as much as might be their Environing Enemy , they had there preserv’d themselves unfrozen in the Form of a high colour’d Liquor , the Aqueous and Spirituous parts having been so sleightly ( Blended rather than ) United in the Decoction , that they were easily Separable by such a Degree of Cold as would not have been able to have Divorc’d the Parts of Urine or Wine , which by Fermentation or Digestion are wont , as Tryal has inform’d me , to be more intimately associated each with other .
But I have already intimated , Eleutherius , that I shall not Insist on this Experiment , not only because , having made it but once I may possibly have been mistaken in it ; but also ( and that principally ) because of that much more full and eminent Experiment of the Separative Virtue of extream Cold , that was made , against their Wills , by the foremention’d Dutch men that Winter’d in Nova Zembla ; the Relation of whose Voyage being a very scarce Book , it will not be amiss to give you that Memorable part of it which concerns our present Theme , as I caus’d the Passage to be extracted out of the Englished Voyage it self .
